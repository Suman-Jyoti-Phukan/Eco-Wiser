# Eco-Wiser Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Eco-Wiser project, a web application built using Vite, React, and Supabase. This project aims to provide an eco-friendly solution for managing notes and tasks.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need to provide your Supabase credentials. Simply add the `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseKey` in the `.env` file, and you'll be good to go.

## Project Structure

The global state management for this project is handled through the `NoteContext`, which is defined in the `NoteContext` directory. All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented as custom hooks in the `apiNote.js` file.
